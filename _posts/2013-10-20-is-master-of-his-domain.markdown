title:  "Being the Master of Your Domain"
---

My name is Jesse Shawl, and I am the master of my domain(s). 

I currently have two primary domains hosted with a new Digital Ocean droplet. After the community learned that Media Temple had been purchased by GoDaddy, web hosts everywhere were offering coupons and new sign-up discounts to anyone who might be in need of a new web host (I know I would).

I punched in the code for $10 credit (two months free of a 51Mb vps), and set up a droplet with Ubuntu 13.04. I thought the new server would be useful for trying out Ghost - a new blogging platform that runs on node.js. 

I have two primary domains hosted on the new vps, whom I named "Frege": jesse.sh and jshawl.com.

First, a note on vanity URLs. It's just that one extra layer of customization
