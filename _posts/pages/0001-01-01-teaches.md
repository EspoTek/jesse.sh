    <h2 class='article-title'>CSS-Tricks: Rethinking Dynamic Page Replacing Content</h2>
    <img src="/img/css-tricks.png" class='project__img' alt="">
    <p>In my spare time, I like to read articles and watch screencasts about all things web. I came across an older screencast by Chris Coyier, and thought of how I could improve upon his demo.
    <p>I tweeted about it, posted it on github, and before you know it, the CSS-Tricks founder asked me to contribute a guest post for the blog.
    <p>It's all about using modern technologies to enhance the user experience without leaving out those who use outdated technologies and browsers. <a href="http://css-tricks.com/rethinking-dynamic-page-replacing-content/">Read the article &raquo;</a> </p>

    <h2 class='article-title'>Getting Started with Python</h2>
    <p><img src="/img/python.png" class='project__img' style='max-width:20%;' alt="">
    <p>I designed a curriculum for TutsPlus Premium, a popular learning resource for all kinds of work.</p>
    <p>In this course, I teach the fundamentals of the Python programming language.</p>
    <p>We start with a very basic "Hello World" and progress all the way to scraping websites using Object Oriented Programming techniques.

    <h2 class='article-title'>How to be a Terminal Pro</h2>
    <p><img src="/img/terminal.png" class='project__img' alt="">
    <p>I'm that developer that looks for a command-line solution for just about everything.
      When TutsPlus tweeted about being in need of a Terminal instructor, I sent in a sample video about setting up SSH keys on Mac OS X, and they loved it!
      I really enjoy making these kinds of courses because I have 100% control over the material and the progression of the lessons. I was able to distill the most important and valuable things that I've learned and give that back to the community in screencast form. (I always find videos to be more helpful than text when it comes to programming) <a href='https://tutsplus.com/course/how-to-be-a-terminal-pro/'>Visit course &raquo;</a>
